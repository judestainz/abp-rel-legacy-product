# Generated contributor kit v2 (policy sha256:0d186e30df53b42a933d67e09771232ec3ac3646ca2bc9948c40f582e214ddf7). Refreshed only by governed upgrade commits; do not edit by hand.
# Purpose: Contributor setup and local validation, derived from this product's approved collaboration policy, so a teammate and their AI run exactly the checks the station will hold them to.
# Learning objectives: See why a missing dependency or an unsupported host is reported with its own exit code instead of guessed around, and why a station-only check is printed as not run and never as passed.
# Responsibilities: Judge the host (doctor), run the declared setup commands once in a clean clone (setup), and run every declared local check while listing the station-only ones (check).
# Key concepts: Declared commands run through sh -c exactly as the policy spells them; FOUND, MISSING, HOST, UNSUPPORTED, PASS, FAIL and STATION-ONLY lines; one SUMMARY line per mode.
# Algorithms: version_at_least compares dotted versions field by field with awk; every other step is a sequential pass over the declared requirements, commands and checks.
# Assumptions: A POSIX sh with awk, grep, uname and command -v on PATH; the script is run from anywhere inside the clone and changes to the repository root itself.
# Inputs and outputs: Reads the mode argument (doctor, setup or check), the PATH and the host's uname and memory facts; writes one report line per judgement to standard output and runs only the declared commands.
# Error handling: Every failure is a printed line and a distinct exit code; nothing is retried, assumed or hidden, and a host the script cannot measure is UNSUPPORTED rather than ready.
# Complexity: Linear in the number of declared requirements, setup commands and local checks; each command runs once.
# Usage: sh scripts/contributor-check.sh doctor|setup|check
# Exit codes: 0 ready or passed, 1 a setup step or local check failed, 2 usage, 3 missing dependency, 4 unsupported host.
# Related files: AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md (the guides that explain these modes), .github/contributor-kit.json and its .LEARNING.md note (the machine-readable policy this script was derived from).
