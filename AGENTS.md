# AGENTS.md — contributor contract for AI coding agents

<!-- Generated contributor kit v2 (policy sha256:0d186e30df53b42a933d67e09771232ec3ac3646ca2bc9948c40f582e214ddf7). Refreshed only by governed upgrade commits; do not edit by hand. -->

You are helping a teammate contribute to this product repository. Everything you need is in this repository and in the task brief the teammate gives you; nothing about the build station that integrates this product is available to you or needed.

## Rules

- Implement exactly one brief at a time, from its exact base commit, inside the paths it lists.
- Run the setup and local checks below, and report each check exactly as the script printed it.
- Never claim a station-only check passed; say it will run on the station after submission.
- If a dependency is missing or the host is unsupported, stop and report the script's `MISSING` or `UNSUPPORTED` line; do not work around it.
- Never commit credentials, tokens, private keys or machine-specific absolute paths.
- Do not edit the files this kit generates (this file, CONTRIBUTING.md, the issue forms, the pull request template, `scripts/contributor-check.sh`, `.github/contributor-kit.json` and its `.LEARNING.md` note); they are refreshed by governed upgrade commits.

## Setup

Run `sh scripts/contributor-check.sh setup` once in a clean clone. It checks the host first, then runs:

- no setup commands are declared

## Local checks versus station-only checks

Run these locally before you submit (`sh scripts/contributor-check.sh check` runs all of them):

- `npm test`

These run ONLY on the station, after you submit. The script prints them as `STATION-ONLY ... not run locally`; never report them as passed:

- none declared

The station re-runs its trusted checks on the exact commit you submit, whatever was reported locally:

- `test` — required, mirrored by the local checks above

## Supported hosts and dependencies

Platforms: linux, darwin. Architectures: x64, arm64.

- `node` 22.0 or newer — Install Node.js 22 or newer from https://nodejs.org

`sh scripts/contributor-check.sh doctor` checks all of this and says exactly what is missing or unsupported. It exits 3 for a missing or too-old dependency and 4 for an unsupported or unmeasurable host; it never reports a host it cannot judge as ready.

## Asking the station for a change

Open the Request issue form and describe what you want in plain words. Read [the request guide](docs/REQUEST_GUIDE.md) for drafting and confirmation.

Your AI can follow [the complete structured sample](docs/REQUEST_SAMPLE.md) to submit a request directly. The station supplies validation; do not specify tests, budgets or reviewers in a request.

## Task briefs and submission

Work starts from a versioned, plan-only brief the station posts on a request issue (open one with the "Plan only" issue form). A brief names the exact base commit, the task ids, acceptance criteria, the paths you may change, contracts, docs and the commands above.

1. Start from `master` at exactly the brief's base commit. If `master` has moved, ask for a fresh brief on the issue rather than rebasing silently; a submission against a stale brief version or base is detected and judged against the current one.
2. Change only the paths the brief lists. Keep out of scope what the brief excludes.
3. Run `sh scripts/contributor-check.sh check` and fix every `FAIL` line.
4. Open one pull request against `master`. Its title follows `[brief-<issue> v<version>] <summary>` and its body carries the line `Implements-Brief: brief-<issue>@v<version> base=<exact base commit>`, exactly as the brief spells it.
5. The station imports your exact base and head, validates the candidate in its sandbox, has it independently reviewed and integrates it. Your pull request closes as absorbed only after a linked publication commit actually delivers the accepted result.
